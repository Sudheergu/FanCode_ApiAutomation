# FanCode API Automation

## Project Overview

This project automates testing for the FanCode city's user todo tasks using various testing tools and libraries, ensuring that all users from the FanCode city have more than 50% of their todo tasks completed.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java** (for writing test scripts)
- **RestAssured** (for API testing)
- **TestNG** (for test execution)
- **ExtentReports** (for generating detailed HTML test reports)
- **Log4j2** (for logging)
  
### Objective:
- To verify that users from FanCode city (identified by specific latitude and longitude ranges) have more than 50% of their todo tasks marked as completed.

## Requirements

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Java 17 or higher**
- **Maven** (for dependency management)
- **IDE** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- **Internet Access** (to fetch dependencies and run the tests)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fanCodeApiAutomation.git
cd fanCodeApiAutomation

2. Install Maven Dependencies
Ensure that Maven is installed. If not, follow the installation guide on the official website.

Once Maven is installed, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
This will download all necessary dependencies for the project.

3. Configure Log4j2 for Logging
This project uses Log4j2 for logging, and the configuration file is located in the src/main/resources directory.

log4j2.xml Example Configuration:
xml
Copy code
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="WARN">
    <Appenders>
        <Console name="Console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
            <PatternLayout pattern="%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n" />
        </Console>
        <File name="File" fileName="logs/test-log.log">
            <PatternLayout pattern="%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n" />
        </File>
    </Appenders>
    
    <Loggers>
        <Root level="INFO">
            <AppenderRef ref="Console" />
            <AppenderRef ref="File" />
        </Root>
    </Loggers>
</Configuration>
Logs will be output to the console and a log file (logs/test-log.log).
The logging level is set to INFO. You can adjust it to DEBUG for more detailed logs.
4. Running the Tests
Once the dependencies are installed and Log4j2 is set up, you can run the tests using TestNG.

Execute the following Maven command to run the tests:

bash
Copy code
mvn test
Test results will appear in the console.
A detailed ExtentReport will be generated as extent-report.html in the root directory. This will show the detailed test execution and results.
Logs will be written to the console and the logs/test-log.log file.
5. Viewing the Test Reports
After executing the tests, the HTML report generated by ExtentReports will be available in the root directory as extent-report.html. Open this file in any web browser to view the detailed results.

└── README.md                         <-- This file
Additional Notes
Logging: Log4j2 is used for logging. The log4j2.xml configuration file is located under src/main/resources/ and controls logging output to the console and a file.
Test Execution: Ensure that the base URI and endpoints are correctly set in the BaseTest.java class.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:

Logs not showing up: Ensure that log4j2.xml is located in the src/main/resources/ directory and is properly configured.
Dependency issues: Run mvn clean install again to resolve missing dependencies.
